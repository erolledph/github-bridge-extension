## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (popup.js)
The frontend handles all user interactions and UI state management:

#### State Management
- **Screen Navigation**: Manages transitions between authentication, repository selection, upload, commit, and success screens
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation of user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display and recovery mechanisms

#### Key Components

- **Repository Browser**: Displays repositories with search and filtering
- **File Processor**: Manages ZIP file extraction and preview
- **Commit Interface**: Provides commit configuration and file change review

### Backend (background.js)
The service worker handles all GitHub API interactions:

#### GitHubService Class
A comprehensive service class that encapsulates all GitHub API operations:

```javascript
class GitHubService {
  constructor(token)
  async makeRequest(endpoint, options)
  async validateToken()
  async getRepositories()
  async getBranches(owner, repo)
  async createRepository(name, description, isPrivate)
  async getBranchDetails(owner, repo, branch)
  async getTree(owner, repo, sha, recursive)
  async getBlobContent(owner, repo, sha)
  async uploadFiles(repository, files, commitInfo, filesToDeletePaths, onProgress)
}
```

#### API Operations
- **Authentication**: Token validation and user information retrieval
- **Repository Operations**: CRUD operations for repositories and branches
- **File Operations**: Tree traversal, blob content retrieval, and file uploads
- **Git Operations**: Commit creation, tree management, and reference updates

### Styling System (popup.css)
A comprehensive design system built with modern CSS:

#### Design Tokens
- **Color System**: 6+ color ramps with semantic naming
- **Typography Scale**: Consistent font sizes and weights
- **Spacing System**: 8px grid-based spacing
- **Component Library**: Reusable button, form, and layout components

#### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for 400px popup width
- **Accessibility**: Focus states, proper contrast ratios, and semantic markup
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover states, transitions, and loading animations
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Clean, professional design following Apple-level design principles

## User Flow

### 1. Initial Setup
1. User installs the Chrome extension
2. User clicks the extension icon to open popup
3. Extension checks for stored GitHub token

### 2. Authentication
1. If no token exists, user is prompted to authenticate
2. User creates a GitHub Personal Access Token with required scopes
3. User enters token in the extension
4. Extension validates token and stores it securely

### 3. Repository Selection
1. Extension fetches user's repositories from GitHub
2. User can search through repositories or create a new one
3. User selects target repository for upload

### 4. File Upload
1. User uploads a ZIP file exported from Bolt.new
2. Extension extracts and previews file contents
3. User confirms the file selection

### 5. Commit Configuration
1. Extension analyzes changes between local and remote files
2. User writes commit message and selects target branch
3. User chooses whether to clear existing files or merge changes
4. User reviews file changes summary

### 6. Upload & Success
1. Extension uploads files to GitHub using Git API
2. Progress is tracked and displayed to user
3. Success screen shows completion with link to GitHub repository

## GitHub API Integration

### Required Scopes
The extension requires the following GitHub token scopes:
- `repo`: Full repository access for reading and writing
- `user:email`: Access to user email for commit attribution

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /user`: User information and token validation
- `GET /user/repos`: Repository listing
- `POST /user/repos`: Repository creation
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches`: Branch listing
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}`: Branch details
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{sha}`: Tree traversal
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/blobs/{sha}`: File content retrieval
- `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees`: Tree creation
- `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/commits`: Commit creation
- `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs/heads/{branch}`: Reference updates

### Rate Limiting
The extension respects GitHub's API rate limits and includes proper error handling for rate limit scenarios.

## Security Considerations

### Token Security
- Tokens are stored using Chrome's secure storage API
- Tokens are never logged or exposed in console output
- All API requests use HTTPS with proper authentication headers

### Content Security Policy
- Strict CSP prevents XSS attacks
- Only allows self-hosted scripts and resources
- No inline scripts or eval() usage

### Data Privacy
- No user data is transmitted to third-party services
- All operations are performed directly between the extension and GitHub
- File contents are processed locally before upload

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Management
- **Network Errors**: Handles API failures and connectivity issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Clear messaging for invalid or expired tokens
- **File Processing Errors**: Validates ZIP files and handles corruption
- **GitHub API Errors**: Translates API errors into user-friendly messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Graceful handling of GitHub API rate limits

### User Feedback
- Real-time error messages with actionable guidance
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Success confirmations with next steps
- Warning messages for destructive operations

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient File Processing
- **Streaming ZIP Processing**: Uses JSZip for efficient file extraction
- **Selective Uploads**: Only uploads changed files to minimize API calls
- **Chunked Operations**: Breaks large operations into manageable chunks
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time feedback for user experience

### Memory Management
- **File Content Streaming**: Processes large files without loading entirely into memory
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper cleanup of temporary objects and event listeners
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimizes memory footprint during file operations

## Browser Compatibility
